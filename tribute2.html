      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga, Punjab, India. He became one of the most prominent
        figures in the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. With his fearless dedication, he
        became a symbol of courage and sacrifice. Bhagat Singh's iconic acts of rebellion, including his role in the
        Assembly Bombing and his defiance against British authority, inspired a whole generation to join the fight
        for freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of his significant contributions include his involvement in the struggle to fight oppression, his
        leadership in revolutionary activities, and his unwavering determination in his fight against tyranny. Despite
        being arrested and executed at the age of 23, his sacrifices and ideas have left a profound legacy in India's
        history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bhagat Singh's execution on March 23, 1931, became a turning point in the freedom movement, encouraging
        millions of Indians to unite for independence. His legacy continues to inspire generations to stand up against
        injustice and fight for equality.
